## npx - a tool that allows you to run Node.js packages without installing them. It is a command-line tool that comes with npm, the package manager for Node.js. npx is useful for running packages that you don't want to install globally, or that you only need to run once. It is also useful for running packages that are not installed on your system, or that you want to run with a specific version of Node.js. npx is a powerful tool that can help you manage your Node.js packages more efficiently and easily.

## create-react-app - a tool that allows you to create a new React project with a single command. It is a command-line tool that comes with npm, the package manager for Node.js. create-react-app is useful for quickly setting up a new React project, as it automates the process of creating the project files and installing the necessary dependencies. It also includes a number of features that make it easy to customize the project, such as the ability to specify the project name and the template to use. create-react-app is a powerful tool that can help you get started with React development quickly and easily.

## problem with create-react-app is that it creates a lot of files and folders that you may not need, and it can be difficult to customize the project structure.And it is bulky, so it takes time to install and run.

## Another ways to create a React app (which is preferred ways nowadays) is to use bundler like vite or parcel. They are faster and more efficient than create-react-app.

## package.json file

## JSX - Jsx is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, which makes it easier to create and manage the structure of your React components. JSX is not a separate language, but a syntax extension that is transformed into regular JavaScript code by a tool called Babel. JSX is a powerful feature of React that allows you to write more expressive and readable code, and to create complex user interfaces more easily.

## Good Practices for creating a component - function name should be start with capital letter

## inside JSX if we have to write JS code we have to use {} curly braces but in those curly braces we can only write final value not any statement or loop or condition. its known as evaluated expression. if we want to perform any logic or condition we have to write it outside of JSX and then use it inside JSX.

## OnCLick() Method requires a function to be passed as a parameter. If we pass a function with () then it will be called immediately. So we have to pass a function without ().
